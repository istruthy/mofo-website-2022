      <title>Ninth Circuit Rejects a Defendant’s Assertion That ESPs Acted as an “Instrument or Agent” of the Government in Searching the Defendant’s Accounts</title>
      <description>        In April 2022, the Ninth Circuit affirmed a lower court’s decision that Electronic Service Providers (ESPs) were not acting as government agents when they searched a user’s accounts for child pornography and reported the material to the government. The decision in United States v. Rosenow largely mirrors that of other circuits. However, Judge Graber, in her dissenting opinion, parted ways with her colleagues when it came to one of these searches. With analysis that would have far-reaching implications, Judge Graber examined the ESPs’ user agreements and concluded that one of the ESPs crossed the threshold and acted as a government agent. The Ninth Circuit will likely consider whether to take this matter en banc.

      <title>DOJ Criminal Division Head Kenneth Polite Proclaims that Chief Compliance Officers Have a “powerful role” to Play in Investigators’ Determination of Compliance Monitorships</title>
      <description>        Speaking at a Compliance Week event on May 17, 2022, Assistant Attorney General (“AAG”) Kenneth Polite reaffirmed that companies that “take compliance seriously” can expect a reduced likelihood that investigators will impose a compliance monitorship. Notably, Polite—himself a former Chief Compliance Officer (“CCO”)—told the audience that CCOs should have a “prominent role” in meetings with investigators, and that CCOs should have “true independence, authority, and stature,” with significant access and resources within the company. Polite cited several examples of actions companies can take to effectively demonstrate a commitment to compliance:

      <title>Justice Department Revises Cyber Crime Charging Policy to Shield Good-Faith Security Research</title>
      <description>        On May 19, 2022, the Department of Justice (DOJ) updated its policy guiding charges under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA), the main law used by prosecutors to charge cyber‑based crimes. The policy changes answer longstanding questions about the language of the CFAA and its potential for broad application. The new policy further refines DOJ’s goals for enforcing the CFAA and establishes as policy DOJ’s longstanding informal position that it will not charge “good-faith security research” as a violation of the CFAA. The new policy also directs that DOJ will not bring CFAA charges in a number of other situations that implicate the Supreme Court’s 2021 decision in Van Buren v. United States[1] and have long concerned courts and legal commentators, such as violations of access restrictions contained in a contractual agreement or terms of service or violations of an employer’s policy against checking sports scores or paying bills at work.

      <title>Technology Companies on Alert - Important Considerations for IT Vendors with U.S. Government Users</title>
      <description>        Many technology companies sell their products or services to the U.S. government through resellers, or do business with companies that use their products or services to serve U.S. government customers. These technology companies are often unaware (or uncertain) that they are federal subcontractors subject to various complex, and sometimes onerous, regulations that can have a significant impact on their operations and strategies. Some companies that sell directly to the U.S. government also fail to flow down government contract requirements to their technology subcontractors where required. In our webinar we will discuss recent developments that make subcontractor determinations even more critical.

      <description>        When did your organization last update its investigation procedures? Recent developments in Europe mean that now may be the right time for a refresh. The EU Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the Protection of Persons Who Report Breaches of Union Law (the Directive) has far-reaching consequences, not only for how organizations set up internal reporting channels, but also for how they carry out internal investigations after receiving an initial report.

      <description>        Designed for busy in-house counsel, compliance professionals, and anti-corruption lawyers, this newsletter summarizes some of the most important international anti-corruption developments from the past month, with links to primary resources. This month we ask: What company resolved Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) allegations with the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) and Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)? What did a federal court have to say about the scope of the FCPA’s internal accounting controls provision? What did the United Nations Human Rights Committee find about the fairness of the corruption investigation and prosecution of a former Brazilian president? The answers to these questions and more are here in our April Top 10 list.

      <title>There is a New Vertical Exemption on the Block</title>
      <description>        The European Commission published the new Vertical Block Exemption Regulation and related guidelines on May 10, 2022.  The purpose of the block exemption is to generally exempt agreements between market players at different levels of the supply chain from the EU’s prohibition on anticompetitive agreements if certain market share thresholds are met and provided the agreement does not contain certain prohibited restrictions. This client alert describes the five main changes in the new block exemption relating to dual distribution, most favored nation clauses, sales restrictions in distribution systems, restrictions of online sales, and non-compete clauses.  It also highlights a few key areas of divergence with the proposed UK regime. In further detail:

      <description>        On 25 April 2022, in collaboration with the UK Independent Anti-Slavery Commissioner, the Financial Reporting Council (“FRC”) published a report on Modern Slavery Reporting Practices in the UK (the “Report”). The Report analyses the reporting practices of 100 major companies, including FTSE 100, FTSE 250 and small market cap companies, summarising the extent to which they are measuring the impact of their initiatives and interventions. The Report findings suggest that modern slavery considerations are still not a principal concern for a vast majority of companies, supported by the following figures based on the companies sampled:

A spotlight continues to shine on the SFO, as the subject of a UK government-commissioned independent review, which was launched to investigate the SFO’s failings in the Unaoil case.

Additionally, he discussed predictions on the trajectory of DOJ enforcement involving life sciences and also provided practical steps for companies to mitigate their risk. </description>

      <title>Cargotec/Konecranes: Failed Shipping Equipment Merger Illustrates Aggressive UK/U.S. Enforcement and Increased Skepticism of Remedies</title>
      <description>        On March 29, 2022, global container handling equipment providers [Cargotec and Konecranes] abandoned their proposed $5 billion merger after the United Kingdom Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) and the U.S. Department of Justice Antitrust Division (DOJ) rejected the parties’ proposed settlements, and the CMA concluded that the transaction should be prohibited. The same remedies had already been accepted by the European Commission, which cleared the merger to proceed in February. This is one of several recent examples of deals being abandoned due to antitrust challenges in the UK and United States.

      <description>        You may be familiar with Binding Corporate Rules (BCRs) in the context of the GDPR and EU data transfers. But long before the GDPR, EU data protection authorities (DPAs) determined that it was possible to transfer personal information to countries outside the EU based on an internal policy that applied to a company group. Through that internal policy, personal information could have the same level of protection throughout the group, regardless of the country where the personal information was transferred.

      <description>        On March 22, 2022, the New York Court of Appeals (the “Court”) issued a decision that brought to a close the long-running litigation contesting the legality of Interactive Fantasy Sports (often referred to as “Daily Fantasy Sports” (DFS)) contests in New York. In a 4-3 decision, Chief Judge Janet DiFiore found that DFS contests are not gambling and therefore the New York legislature had the authority under the New York State Constitution to regulate DFS contests.</description>

      <description>        In recent years, more consumers, merchants, and financial institutions have accepted cryptocurrency as a form of payment for everyday products and services. Last November, mayors of two major U.S. cities signaled what may be the next phase of cryptocurrency’s melding into the mundane, when they announced they would accept paychecks in cryptocurrency. On Twitter, Mayor Francis Suarez of Miami said he would accept his next paycheck in Bitcoin, to which Mayor Eric Adams of New York responded that he would accept his first three paychecks in Bitcoin.

      <description>        The impact of COVID-19 led competitors to collaborate to meet public needs. The Defense Production Act, the Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Act, and DOJ’s Business Review Letter process offered ways for businesses to mitigate the antitrust risk of doing so and even to obtain immunity. Looking ahead, what are the implications of these COVID-19 collaborations for antitrust counselors and litigators?

      <title>Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Director Joins Law Enforcement Focus on Corporate Recidivism</title>
      <description>        The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) has made it clear that corporate recidivism is now a top priority of its enforcement efforts. On March 28, 2022, CFPB Director Rohit Chopra delivered a lecture, titled Reining in Repeat Offenders at the University of Pennsylvania Program on Regulation. During his lecture, Chopra indicated that the CFPB, which enforces consumer financial protection laws, will seek to deter corporate recidivism by imposing tougher sanctions on institutions that have previously failed to comply with orders issued by courts or regulators. Chopra’s remarks follow similar indications made by other law enforcement leaders, including Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco, who emphasized a focus corporate recidivism during her keynote address at ABA’s 36th National Institute on White Collar Crime in October 2021. By way of the address and a U.S. Department of Justice memorandum, Monaco directed prosecutors to consider the full criminal, civil, and regulatory records of companies that are targets of criminal investigations, as well as their affiliates, rather than just the specific conduct at issue in that particular investigation in order to assess a company’s overall commitment to compliance when pursuing prosecutions and considering corporate resolutions.

      <description>        Following a 27-year drought of copyright fair use cases, the Supreme Court is now set to take on its second case on the doctrine in two years.  The high court granted a petition this week in Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts, Inc. v. Goldsmith, No. 21-869—less than 12 months after its 2021 fair use opinion in Google v. Oracle—to revisit this defense once more.

      <title>Important Changes to Japan&apos;s Privacy Law Take Effect April 1, 2022: Is Your Business Ready?</title>
      <description>        Next month, businesses located outside of Japan that provide goods or services to Japanese consumers and businesses may soon feel the long arm of Japan’s privacy regulator, the Personal Information Protection Commission (“PIPC”). When amendments to the Personal Information Protection Act (“PIPA Amendments”) take effect on April 1, foreign business will be subject to all obligations and restrictions under PIPA, including investigations and orders from the PIPC. Until now, these types of investigations and orders were limited to businesses located in Japan. These PIPA Amendments also impact businesses in Japan by making significant changes to existing privacy compliance requirements. The PIPA Amendments, related guidelines, and enforcement orders impose new compliance obligations in several key areas, including data breach notification, cross-border data transfers, and the use of cookies.

      <title>California AG Issues First CCPA Opinion: Consumers’ “Right to Know” Includes Businesses’ Internally Generated Inferences</title>
      <description>        The California Office of the Attorney General (OAG) recently concluded that the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) generally requires a covered business to disclose, upon request, its inferences about a consumer—whether generated internally or obtained from another source—unless the business can demonstrate that a statutory exception applies. In its first formal opinion (No. 20-303) under the CCPA, OGC has thus taken an expansive view of a consumer’s CCPA “right to know” the specific pieces of personal information that a business collects.  </description>

      <title>Forecasting White Collar Enforcement Trends in California for 2022</title>
      <description>        In the first year of the Biden administration, leadership at the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and other U.S. government agencies announced expansive efforts to investigate and prosecute white-collar crime. These efforts included the creation of task forces and policy changes that grant the government greater resources and powers to pursue white-collar criminal enforcement actions.[i] In California, the new year brings with it several noteworthy white-collar trials in federal courts around the state as well as expectations that we will see enhanced enforcement actions as the current administration focuses on corporate crime, government procurement fraud, and pandemic-related fraud.

      <title>A MoFo Privacy Minute Q&amp;A: Belgian Regulator Further Shapes the Contours on When to Appoint a DPO and Who Can Hold the Position</title>
      <description>        Under the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), organizations must appoint a Data Protection Officer (DPO) if their core activities consist of processing operations that require regular and systematic monitoring of individuals on a large scale (GDPR Art. 37.1.a). The Belgian Data Protection Authority (DPA) recently provided its opinion on this requirement for cookies, as well as on conflicts of interest affecting a DPO role.

      <title>U.S. Congress Passes Cyber Incident and Ransom Payment Reporting Requirement</title>
      <description>        Energy, financial services, food and agriculture, healthcare, information technology, defense industrial base, and other critical infrastructure entities in the United States may face new cyber incident reporting requirements as a result of legislation that is likely to pass Congress this year. On March 1, 2022, the U.S. Senate passed S. 3600, the Strengthening American Cybersecurity Act of 2022 (S. 3600 or the Act), which, among other things, would require critical infrastructure entities to report cyber incidents to the Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS) Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) within 72 hours and to report ransom payments in response to ransomware attacks within 24 hours. The Act also includes several provisions that would cement the role of CISA as the central coordinating agency of information related to cyber attacks, as well as other measures designed to modernize and improve the federal government’s information technology and security, including its cloud-based security.

      <title>International Arbitration Update: Discovery in Aid of International Arbitration – Amici Weigh in Before Supreme Court Argument</title>
      <description>        On December 10, 2021, the United States Supreme Court agreed to hear two cases—ZF Automotive US, Inc. v. Luxshare, Ltd., No. 21-401, and AlixPartners, LLP v. Fund for Prot. of Investors’ Rights in Foreign States, No. 21-518—to decide whether 28 U.S.C. § 1782 (“Section 1782”), which permits litigants to seek the assistance of U.S. district courts in obtaining evidence for use in a “foreign or international tribunal,” applies to private commercial arbitral tribunals or only to treaty-based arbitral tribunals.[1] The Court has consolidated the two cases and will hear oral argument on March 23, 2022.

      <title>Monopolists Going “Directly to Jail?” DOJ Announces Intent to Criminally Prosecute Section 2 Violations</title>
      <description>        In the latest sign of the Biden administration’s aggressive antitrust enforcement agenda, on March 2, 2022, while speaking on a panel at the ABA White Collar Crime Conference in San Francisco, Deputy Assistant Attorney General Richard Powers remarked that the Department of Justice’s (“DOJ”) Antitrust Division (“Division”) is prepared to bring criminal charges for violations of Section 2 of the Sherman Act.  Section 2 prohibits single-firm conduct that creates or maintains monopoly power. In response to questions regarding the DOJ’s willingness to bring criminal charges in monopolization cases, Powers noted that the DOJ would bring criminal charges “if the facts and the law lead us to the conclusion that a criminal charge based on a Section 2 violation is warranted.” Principal Assistant Attorney General Doha Mekki later echoed Powers’ statements when speaking at a lunch at the conference.

      <title>Takeaways for In-House Counsel from the SEC’s “Shadow Insider Trading” Action</title>
      <description>        In January 2022, a federal district court denied a motion to dismiss a novel insider trading enforcement action brought by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission based upon a theory known as “shadow insider trading.” In SEC v. Panuwat, the SEC takes the position that the insider trading laws apply where an insider uses material nonpublic information about his or her own company to trade securities of another company, such as a competitor or peer company in the same industry.

      <title>Risks Increase as UK Government Seeks to Introduce Strict Liability for Sanction Breaches</title>
      <description>        At a time when sanctions are very much in the spotlight, the UK government has proposed amendments to its sanctions regime in order to introduce a ‘strict civil liability’ test for sanctions breaches. This change brings the UK regime in line with its U.S. equivalent and should make it easier for the Office of Sanctions Implementation (“OFSI”) to impose significant financial penalties against organisations that breach sanctions. Further changes would see OFSI given the power to ‘name and shame’ entities that have breached financial sanctions, even where a fine has not been imposed.

      <title>Ukraine Crisis: UK Parliament Targets Opaque Property Ownership</title>
      <description>        In the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the UK government has brought forward legislation that aims to crack down on foreign owners laundering dirty money through UK property and make it easier for law enforcement agencies to use Unexplained Wealth Orders (UWOs). UWOs enable law enforcement to confiscate criminal assets without ever having to prove that the property was obtained from criminal activity.

      <description>        On February 9, 2022, the Hong Kong International Arbitration Centre (“HKIAC”) released its annual statistics for 2021. The statistics suggest that HKIAC, while not as busy as it was during the record-breaking year 2020, continued to prosper as a popular venue for cross-border disputes.

      <description>        After less than a week of a full-scale war between Russia and Ukraine, the post-Cold War global architecture appears irrevocably shattered, as Western nations line up to offer support and military and economic aid to Ukraine and a multinational sanctions response declares, in effect, economic war against Russia in response to its violent military assault on its neighbor.</description>

      <title>Private Sector Directed to Be on Alert for Potential Russian Cyber Attacks</title>
      <description>        As the Russian invasion of Ukraine becomes a protracted campaign, and as the United States and other countries impose sanctions and other penalties on Russia in response, the possibility of Russian cyberattacks directed at the West (or that spill from Ukraine) looms large. The Cybersecurity &amp; Infrastructure Security Agency (“CISA”) of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, along with the Federal Bureau of Investigation, National Security Agency, and other agencies recently issued a series of alerts to highlight the possibility of destructive malware attacks, ransomware, and other malicious cyber activity being fueled by the conflict in Ukraine, including specific risks directed at the defense contracting community and operators of critical infrastructure. </description>

      <title>Sustainability and Antitrust – What Companies Need to Know About Sustainability Collaborations in Europe</title>
      <description>        Becoming more sustainable is an epic task. Not only for governments, but for society as a whole. Companies notice this as customers are increasingly demanding sustainable products. To remain competitive, it is important for companies to take an active role in fostering sustainability initiatives. Such initiatives often require joining forces and include an alignment on certain competitive parameters, like on the use of certain sustainable production standards to reduce environmental pollution. But alignment on competitive parameters brings EU antitrust laws to the table. This client alert describes what all companies need to know to avoid a breach of EU antitrust laws when entering into sustainability collaborations.
