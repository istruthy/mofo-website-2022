																			<p></p><p><b>1. </b><b>Has the implementing law been adopted?</b></p>
<p>Yes, the <a target="_blank" href="https://narodne-novine.nn.hr/clanci/sluzbeni/2022_04_46_572.html">Law on the Protection of Reporters of Irregularities</a> (the “<b>Law</b>”) entered into force on April 23, 2022.</p>
<p><b>2. </b><b>Under the implementing law, which organizations must establish internal reporting channels?</b></p>
<p>Organizations employing at least 50 employees must establish an internal reporting channel. Organizations with fewer than 50 employees may establish an internal reporting channel if they wish to do so.  Organizations carrying out the following activities must establish an internal reporting channel, irrespective of the number of employees: (i) financial services; (ii) financial products and markets; and (iii) prevention of money laundering and terrorist financing.</p>
<p><b>3. </b><b>Does the implementing law in any way deviate from the Directive in terms of which organizations must establish internal reporting channels?</b></p>
<p>All organizations with 50 or more employees must set up an internal reporting channel by June 23, 2022. The Law does not provide the additional time for private organizations with 50 to 249 employees to establish internal reporting channels that the Directive allowed for EU Member States.</p>
<p><b>4. </b><b>Is the scope of reportable concerns the same as in the Directive?</b></p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p><b>5. </b><b>Does the implementing law permit anonymous reporting?</b></p>
<p>The Law does not explicitly permit anonymous reporting; however, it refers indirectly to persons making anonymous reports being entitled to protection irrespective of the fact that they have come forward anonymously, which would indicate that anonymous reporting is permitted. There is no specific regulatory guidance about anonymous reporting at this time.</p>
<p><b>6. </b><b>Does the implementing law impose any other significant deviations from the Directive, relating to:</b></p>
<ol> </ol> 
<ul>
<li><b>How organizations should set up internal reporting channels?</b></li>
<li><b>Timelines for report management vis-à-vis the whistleblower?</b></li>
<li><b>The content of the required communications (such as privacy notices, report receipts and investigation updates)?</b></li>
<li><b>Whistleblower rights and protections?</b></li>
<li><b>Any other key issues?</b></li>
</ul>
<p>Organizations that are subject to the Law are required to designate (i) a “<i>confidential person</i>” and (ii) a deputy who will take on the role of the confidential person when the confidential person is not available. The confidential person and deputy can be individuals employed by the organization, or third-party individuals, who are to be responsible for overseeing whistleblowing compliance and the organization’s internal reporting channels. There is no information at this time about the eligibility requirements for a confidential person or deputy.</p>
<p>The confidential person must provide feedback to the whistleblower and “<i>take action</i>” to investigate the reported issue within 30 days where possible (or within 90 days at the latest). There is no definition in the Law for what constitutes “<i>take action</i>” and there is no regulatory guidance at this time.</p>
<p><b>7. </b><b>Which national authority has been designated as the competent authority for receiving and investigating whistleblowing concerns and complaints (“Competent Authority”)?</b></p>
<p>The <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ombudsman.hr/en/">Ombudswoman</a>.</p>
<p><b>8. </b><b>Does the Competent Authority have specific investigative and enforcement powers?</b></p>
<p>The Ombudswoman may only (i) refer matters relating to whistleblowing to the Misdemeanor Court for review or (ii) receive and forward whistleblowing reports to the relevant body for further investigation. The relevant body will depend on the subject matter of the report, although there is no direction in the Law as to which body is responsible for which types of reports. The Ombudswoman does not have any enforcement powers.</p>
<p><b>9. </b><b>What are the sanctions for non-compliance with the Directive and the implementing law?</b></p>
<p>Organizations may be fined by the Misdemeanor Court between HRK 10,000 and 30,000 (approx. EUR 1,300 and 4,000) for failing to:</p>
<p>a) Implement the Law within two months of the Law going into force (i.e., by June 23, 2022);</p>
<p>b) Establish an internal reporting system;</p>
<p>c) Protect the personal data received via a whistleblowing report;</p>
<p>d) Appoint a confidential person within three months of the Law going into force (i.e., by July 23, 2022);</p>
<p>e) Keep adequate records; or</p>
<p>f) Take measures to remedy acts or omissions that are unlawful.</p>
<p>In addition, responsible persons at an organization (i.e., individuals responsible for conducting the business affairs of the organization, e.g., a director) or small business owners (i.e., individuals who run unincorporated companies, in accordance with the Trades and Crafts Act) may be fined between HRK 1,000 and 10,000 (approx. EUR 130 and 1,300) for failing to implement the Law within two months of the Law going into force.</p>
<p>Organizations may also be fined between HRK 30,000 and 50,000 (approx. EUR 1,300 and 6,600) if they:</p>
<p>a) Prevent or attempt to prevent individuals from reporting acts or omissions that are unlawful;</p>
<p>b) Initiate malicious proceedings against acts or omissions that are unlawful (malicious proceedings are proceedings with no real basis, e.g., discrimination or defamation);</p>
<p>c) Disclose or attempt to disclose the identity of a person making a report;</p>
<p>d) Retaliate against a person making a report;</p>
<p>e) Fail to protect a person making a report from retaliation; or</p>
<p>f) Influence or attempt to influence those taking action to protect a report or a reporting person (e.g., negatively influence those individuals who are tasked with keeping a whistleblower’s identity confidential and ensuring that they do not suffer retaliation).</p>
<p>In addition, responsible persons at an organization and small business owners may be fined between HRK 3,000 and 30,000 (approx. EUR 400 and 4,000) for preventing or attempting to prevent individuals from reporting acts or omissions that are unlawful. <b></b></p><p></p>

<ol class="li-margin" start="3">
<li><b>Does the implementing law in any way deviate from the Directive in terms of which organizations must establish internal reporting channels?</b></li>

<p>The Law encourages organizations with fewer than 50 employees to establish internal reporting channels, by stating that individuals may report to their direct or indirect supervisor, employer, or other point of contact designated by the organization, even if the organization is not required to establish internal reporting channels. </p>
<ol class="li-margin" start="4">

</ol>
<p>The <a target="_blank" href="https://defenseurdesdroits.fr/fr"><i>Défenseur des droits</i></a> (“<b>Defender of Rights</b>”) is the key Competent Authority, although others have also been appointed for specific sectors under law n° 2017-55 “<i>LOI</i> <i>portant statut général des autorités administratives indépendantes et des autorités publiques indépendantes”</i>.</p>

<li><b>Does the Competent Authority have specific investigative and enforcement powers?</b></li>
</ol>
<p>Under the Law, the Defender of Rights is expressly tasked with supporting whistleblowers. The Defender of Rights has the power to issue an official opinion to “certify” whistleblowers (this would involve verifying that the whistleblower’s report was valid and that the individual should be protected as a whistleblower). This certification may be used if a whistleblower suffered retaliation for making a report and then later commences legal proceedings against the individual or organization who retaliated against them.    </p>
<ol class="li-margin" start="9">
<li><b>What are the sanctions for non-compliance with the Directive and the implementing law?</b></li>
</ol>
<p>The Law does not provide penalties against organizations that fail to set up an internal reporting channel.</p>
<p>The Law increases the fine that may be levied against an individual who retaliates against a whistleblower to EUR 60,000 and against an organization to EUR 300,000 in addition to any supplemental measures to publicize the decision condemning any retaliation. In addition, any person who obstructs a whistleblower’s report may be sanctioned up to one year’s imprisonment.</p>
<p>The Law also permits imposing: (i) a fine of up to EUR 30,000 against an individual or EUR 150,000 against an organization; or (ii) a sanction of two years’ imprisonment against any person who discloses the confidential aspects of a whistleblower’s report (including the identity of the whistleblower and any implicated individuals).</p><p></p>

<li>First assess whether or not the report should be deemed a whistleblower’s report (and therefore benefit from corresponding protections under the Law) and inform the whistleblower within three days of the decision. There is no further regulatory guidance on how organizations should make this assessment or what they should factor in.</li>
<li>Pseudonymize the whistleblower’s personal data from the start of the investigation so that the whistleblower’s identity is only known to certain authorized individuals within the organization. No additional regulatory guidance is provided as to how organizations should carry out the pseudonymization.</li>
<li>Inform the whistleblower of the status of the investigation within two months from receipt of the report (regardless of whether or not the investigation has closed). </li>

Does the implementing law impose any other significant deviations from the Directive, relating to:</b></p> <ul> <li><b>How organizations should set up internal reporting channels?</b></li> <li><b>Timelines for report management vis-à-vis the whistleblower?</b></li> <li><b>The content of the required communications (such as privacy notices, report receipts and investigation updates)?</b></li> <li><b>Whistleblower rights and protections?</b></li> <li><b>Any other key issues?</b></li> </ul> <p>Organizations must:</p> <ul> <li>Acknowledge receipt of the report within two working days. This is quicker than the Directive, which requires receipt within seven days.</li> <li>Inform the whistleblower of the progress of the investigation (the investigative steps envisaged or carried out by the organization and the organization’s justification for doing this) within 10 working days from the acknowledgment of receipt of the report, including if an investigation is still ongoing.</li> <li>Inform the whistleblower of the results of the investigation upon completion; this is not a requirement under the Directive. The Law does not explicitly state how much detail should be provided to the whistleblower about the results, and further regulatory guidance will help in this matter.</li> <li>Keep a record of the investigation for at least five years from the last decision made by the organization in relation to the investigation.</li> </ul> <p>Whistleblowers may bypass an organization’s internal reporting channel under certain circumstances, including, but not limited to, when the infringement is of substantial importance for the public interest or when the whistleblower cannot use the internal channel because they do not have an employment, service, or other legal relationship with the organization.</p> <p>Organizations may provide remuneration to whistleblowers who have provided valuable information. The remuneration is not limited to a specific amount.</p> <p><b>7. Which national authority has been designated as the competent authority for receiving and investigating whistleblowing concerns and complaints (“Competent Authority”)?</b></p> <p>The Public Prosecutor’s Office.</p> <p><b>8. Does the Competent Authority have specific investigative and enforcement powers?</b></p> <p>The Competent Authority can investigate reports using its full prosecutorial powers, including the ability to initiate and carry out prosecution of the offending party or parties.</p> <p><b>9. What are the sanctions for non-compliance with the Directive and the implementing law?</b></p> <p>The Law does not provide for any sanctions against organizations. Only individuals who violate the Law may be found liable, in accordance with Code of Administrative Offences of the Republic of Lithuania. Where an organization does not comply with the Law, sanctions are likely to be applied to the CEO (or an equivalent person who has been formally designated to be in charge of the organization).</p><p></p>

																			<p><ol> <li><b>Has the implementing law been adopted?</b> <p>Yes, Malta adopted its implementing law by amending the <a href="https://legislation.mt/eli/cap/527/eng/pdf">Protection of the Whistleblower Act</a> (the “<b>Act</b>”). The <a href="https://legislation.mt/eli/act/2021/67">amendments</a> were adopted on December 18, 2021 and entered into force on December 24, 2021.</p> </li> <li><b>Under the implementing law, which organizations must establish internal reporting channels?</b> <p>The following organizations are required to establish internal reporting channels:</p> <ul> <li>Any private-sector organization with 50 or more workers;</li> <li>Any voluntary organization that annually raises more than €500,000 from public collections and other donations; and</li> <li>Each ministry of the government of Malta.</li> </ul> </li> <li><b>Does the implementing law in any way deviate from the Directive in terms of which organizations must establish internal reporting channels?</b> <p>Yes, the Act also applies to certain voluntary organizations (see above).</p> </li> <li><b>Is the scope of reportable concerns the same as in the Directive?</b> <p>No, the scope is broader. For example, reports can cover when:</p> <ul> <li>An individual fails to comply (or is likely to fail to comply) with any legal obligation to which they are subject;</li> <li>The health or safety of any individual is (or is likely to be) endangered;</li> <li>The environment is (or is likely to be) damaged; or</li> <li>A corrupt practice has occurred (or is likely to have occurred).</li> </ul> <p>The full list of reportable concerns (described in the Act as “improper practices”) is included in Article 2(1) of the Act.</p> </li> <li><b>Does the implementing law permit anonymous reporting?</b> <p>Yes, but anonymous reports are not treated as “protected disclosures” under the Act. This means that the requirements for organizations to acknowledge receipt of the report and provide feedback do not apply to anonymous reports.</p> <p>However, if after reporting to the public, the identity of the whistleblower is made public and they subsequently suffer retaliation, their disclosure will still be protected provided that:</p> <ul> <li>The whistleblower has reasonable grounds to believe the report is true and that it falls within the scope of the Act; and</li> <li>The whistleblower has the right to report to the public under the Act.</li> </ul> </li> <li><b>Does the implementing law impose any other significant deviations from the Directive, relating to:</b>  <ul> <li><b>How organizations should set up internal reporting channels?</b></li> <li><b>Timelines for report management vis-à-vis the whistleblower?</b></li> <li><b>The content of the required communications (such as privacy notices, report receipts and investigation updates)?</b></li> <li><b>Whistleblower rights and protections?</b></li> <li><b>Any other key issues?</b></li> </ul> <p>The Act provides additional possibilities for whistleblowers to report externally without first using internal reporting channels, in addition to those set out in the Directive. For example, a whistleblower may report directly to a Competent Authority (as defined in Q7 below) where the head of the organization is (or may be) involved in the issue, or where reporting directly to a Competent Authority is justified by the urgency of the matter.</p> </li> <li><b>Which national authority has been designated as the competent authority for receiving and investigating whistleblowing concerns and complaint (“Competent Authority”)?</b> <p>Malta has nominated various Competent Authorities, depending on the subject matter/context of the report (for a full list, see the table in the First Schedule of the Act).</p> </li> <li><b>Does the Competent Authority have specific investigative and enforcement powers?</b> <p>No.</p> </li> <li><b>What are the sanctions for non-compliance with the Directive and the implementing law?</b> <p>The Act does not provide penalties against <i>organizations</i>, e.g., in case an organization does not set up an internal reporting channel or otherwise does not comply with the Act. It is possible that penalties for organizations will be added to the Act in the future by means of an additional amendment. It is currently unclear whether the Maltese government intends to make such an amendment, and further regulatory guidance is needed on this matter.</p> <p>The Act does, however, provide criminal sanctions against <i>individuals</i> who take certain actions (such as using or threatening to use violence) with the purpose of preventing a whistleblower from making a report under the Act.</p> <p>Furthermore, if a whistleblower believes that they have been retaliated against for making a report under the Act, they are also entitled to file an application to the civil court to request an injunction or an order (including an order to pay damages) against an individual. The Act specifies that whistleblowers who have suffered retaliation for making a report are entitled to compensation, but it does not explain if or when organizations (rather than specific individuals) will be liable to pay such compensation.</p> </li> </ol></p>

<p>No, the scope is broader. Reports can cover, for example, violent crimes, as set out in Crimes under Law no. 5/2002 of 11 January, such as trafficking of narcotics and weapons, terrorism, corruption, embezzlement, money laundering, smuggling, vehicle theft, solicitation, and forgery.</p>

<p>Once the investigation has concluded, the whistleblower may request to receive the outcome of the investigation. The outcome must be provided within 15 days from the receipt of the request. There are no guidelines yet as to the level of detail and content of the response.  </p>
<p>Organizations must keep a record of the reports received for at least five years or while legal proceedings relating to the concern are pending (whichever is longer).</p>
<p>Whistleblowers may bypass an organization’s internal reporting channel when they want to report about crimes or administrative offenses that are punishable by a fine greater than EUR 50,000 (a threshold that we understand is a regular feature in other Portuguese laws). While whistleblowers are not expected to know which offenses or violations could qualify under this exception, they will nevertheless enjoy this protection, should they wish to circumvent the internal process and instead report directly to the external channels.</p>
<ol class="li-margin" start="7">
<li><strong>Which national authority has been designated as the competent authority for receiving and investigating whistleblowing concerns and complaint (“Competent Authority”)?</strong></li>

<p>Portugal has nominated various Competent Authorities, depending on the subject-matter/context of the report (for a full list, see Article 12 of <a href="https://app.parlamento.pt/webutils/docs/doc.pdf?path=6148523063484d364c793968636d356c6443397a6158526c6379395953565a4d5a5763765130394e4c7a464451554e45544563765247396a6457316c626e527663306c7561574e7059585270646d46446232317063334e686279387a4d3245354d6a497a5979316a595463344c545268595451744f544d344d53307a5a545a6c4d54526a4d3245794d6d55756347526d&amp;fich=33a9223c-ca78-4aa4-9381-3e6e14c3a22e.pdf&amp;Inline=true" target="_blank">the Act</a>, in Portuguese only).</p>
<p>Where no Competent Authority has been assigned to deal with the report or where a report implicates a Competent Authority, such report must be addressed to the National Anti-Corruption Mechanism (<em>Mecanismo Nacional Anticorrupção</em>), an independent administrative entity.</p>
<ol class="li-margin" start="8">
<li><strong>Does the Competent Authority have specific investigative and enforcement powers? </strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Yes.

<ol class="li-margin" start="9">
<li><strong>What are the sanctions for non-compliance with the Directive and the implementing law? </strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Varying administrative fines, depending on the seriousness of the violation.</p>
<ul class="li-margin">
<li>Very serious offenses: obstructing the reporting or follow-up on a report, engaging in retaliatory acts, failing to comply with the duty of confidentiality, and communicating or publicly disclosing false information.</li>
<ul class="li-margin">
<li>Fines range from EUR 10,000 - 250,000 for organizations.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<ul class="li-margin">
<li>Serious offenses: among others, failing to have an internal reporting channel, not managing reports in an independent and impartial manner, and refusing a face-to-face meeting with the whistleblower.</li>
<ul class="li-margin">
<li>Fines range from EUR 1,000 - 125,000 for organizations.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>Individuals may also be fined for serious and very serious offenses (such as communicating or publicly disclosing false information), in keeping with a separate penalty structure.</p><p></p>
