      <title>Ninth Circuit Rejects a Defendant’s Assertion That ESPs Acted as an “Instrument or Agent” of the Government in Searching the Defendant’s Accounts</title>
      <description>        In April 2022, the Ninth Circuit affirmed a lower court’s decision that Electronic Service Providers (ESPs) were not acting as government agents when they searched a user’s accounts for child pornography and reported the material to the government. The decision in United States v. Rosenow largely mirrors that of other circuits. However, Judge Graber, in her dissenting opinion, parted ways with her colleagues when it came to one of these searches. With analysis that would have far-reaching implications, Judge Graber examined the ESPs’ user agreements and concluded that one of the ESPs crossed the threshold and acted as a government agent. The Ninth Circuit will likely consider whether to take this matter en banc.

      <title>Justice Department Revises Cyber Crime Charging Policy to Shield Good-Faith Security Research</title>
      <description>        On May 19, 2022, the Department of Justice (DOJ) updated its policy guiding charges under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA), the main law used by prosecutors to charge cyber‑based crimes. The policy changes answer longstanding questions about the language of the CFAA and its potential for broad application. The new policy further refines DOJ’s goals for enforcing the CFAA and establishes as policy DOJ’s longstanding informal position that it will not charge “good-faith security research” as a violation of the CFAA. The new policy also directs that DOJ will not bring CFAA charges in a number of other situations that implicate the Supreme Court’s 2021 decision in Van Buren v. United States[1] and have long concerned courts and legal commentators, such as violations of access restrictions contained in a contractual agreement or terms of service or violations of an employer’s policy against checking sports scores or paying bills at work.

      <title>After the whistle blew…</title>
      <description>        When did your organization last update its investigation procedures? Recent developments in Europe mean that now may be the right time for a refresh. The EU Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the Protection of Persons Who Report Breaches of Union Law (the Directive) has far-reaching consequences, not only for how organizations set up internal reporting channels, but also for how they carry out internal investigations after receiving an initial report.

      <description>        You may be familiar with Binding Corporate Rules (BCRs) in the context of the GDPR and EU data transfers. But long before the GDPR, EU data protection authorities (DPAs) determined that it was possible to transfer personal information to countries outside the EU based on an internal policy that applied to a company group. Through that internal policy, personal information could have the same level of protection throughout the group, regardless of the country where the personal information was transferred.

      <title>Important Changes to Japan&apos;s Privacy Law Take Effect April 1, 2022: Is Your Business Ready?</title>
      <description>        Next month, businesses located outside of Japan that provide goods or services to Japanese consumers and businesses may soon feel the long arm of Japan’s privacy regulator, the Personal Information Protection Commission (“PIPC”). When amendments to the Personal Information Protection Act (“PIPA Amendments”) take effect on April 1, foreign business will be subject to all obligations and restrictions under PIPA, including investigations and orders from the PIPC. Until now, these types of investigations and orders were limited to businesses located in Japan. These PIPA Amendments also impact businesses in Japan by making significant changes to existing privacy compliance requirements. The PIPA Amendments, related guidelines, and enforcement orders impose new compliance obligations in several key areas, including data breach notification, cross-border data transfers, and the use of cookies.

      <title>California AG Issues First CCPA Opinion: Consumers’ “Right to Know” Includes Businesses’ Internally Generated Inferences</title>
      <description>        The California Office of the Attorney General (OAG) recently concluded that the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) generally requires a covered business to disclose, upon request, its inferences about a consumer—whether generated internally or obtained from another source—unless the business can demonstrate that a statutory exception applies. In its first formal opinion (No. 20-303) under the CCPA, OGC has thus taken an expansive view of a consumer’s CCPA “right to know” the specific pieces of personal information that a business collects.  </description>

      <title>A MoFo Privacy Minute Q&amp;A: Belgian Regulator Further Shapes the Contours on When to Appoint a DPO and Who Can Hold the Position</title>
      <description>        Under the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), organizations must appoint a Data Protection Officer (DPO) if their core activities consist of processing operations that require regular and systematic monitoring of individuals on a large scale (GDPR Art. 37.1.a). The Belgian Data Protection Authority (DPA) recently provided its opinion on this requirement for cookies, as well as on conflicts of interest affecting a DPO role.

      <title>U.S. Congress Passes Cyber Incident and Ransom Payment Reporting Requirement</title>
      <description>        Energy, financial services, food and agriculture, healthcare, information technology, defense industrial base, and other critical infrastructure entities in the United States may face new cyber incident reporting requirements as a result of legislation that is likely to pass Congress this year. On March 1, 2022, the U.S. Senate passed S. 3600, the Strengthening American Cybersecurity Act of 2022 (S. 3600 or the Act), which, among other things, would require critical infrastructure entities to report cyber incidents to the Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS) Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) within 72 hours and to report ransom payments in response to ransomware attacks within 24 hours. The Act also includes several provisions that would cement the role of CISA as the central coordinating agency of information related to cyber attacks, as well as other measures designed to modernize and improve the federal government’s information technology and security, including its cloud-based security.

      <title>Private Sector Directed to Be on Alert for Potential Russian Cyber Attacks</title>
      <description>        As the Russian invasion of Ukraine becomes a protracted campaign, and as the United States and other countries impose sanctions and other penalties on Russia in response, the possibility of Russian cyberattacks directed at the West (or that spill from Ukraine) looms large. The Cybersecurity &amp; Infrastructure Security Agency (“CISA”) of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, along with the Federal Bureau of Investigation, National Security Agency, and other agencies recently issued a series of alerts to highlight the possibility of destructive malware attacks, ransomware, and other malicious cyber activity being fueled by the conflict in Ukraine, including specific risks directed at the defense contracting community and operators of critical infrastructure. </description>
