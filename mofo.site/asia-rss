      <title>DOJ Seeks to Require U.S. Businessman to Register as a Foreign Agent on Expansive Agency Theory</title>
      <description>        Earlier this week, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) filed a civil enforcement action seeking to compel U.S. businessman Steve Wynn to register under the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA) as an agent of the Chinese government. The complaint alleges that in 2017—at the request of a Chinese government official—Wynn communicated to President Trump and other administration officials the Chinese government’s desire for the United States to cancel the visa of a Chinese national who was charged with corruption in China and sought political asylum in the United States. According to the DOJ, Wynn acceded to these requests to protect his business interests in Macau.

      <title>Global Sanctions on Russia Escalate in Response to Russia’s Continued Bloody Invasion of Ukraine</title>
      <description>        As Russia’s bloody invasion of Ukraine nears the end of its second month, with regular reports of human rights violations, possible chemical weapons attacks, and head of state musings regarding whether this campaign amounts to a genocide, governments around the world continue to coordinate and respond with increasingly severe sanctions and export controls.  Specifically, the United States, European Union, United Kingdom, Japan, and other global allies have repeatedly responded by escalating trade restrictions targeting Russia. Since the developments discussed in our previous client alerts on Feb. 28 and Mar. 22, these jurisdictions have coordinated to significantly escalate sanctions and export controls targeting Russian President Vladimir Putin’s regime, Kremlin-connected Russian elites, and the Russian economy. While the new and expanded sanctions in each of these jurisdictions generally appear to have been coordinated, each jurisdiction has unique sanctions, deadlines, and applications, increasing compliance complexities.

      <title>Important Changes to Japan&apos;s Privacy Law Take Effect April 1, 2022: Is Your Business Ready?</title>
      <description>        Next month, businesses located outside of Japan that provide goods or services to Japanese consumers and businesses may soon feel the long arm of Japan’s privacy regulator, the Personal Information Protection Commission (“PIPC”). When amendments to the Personal Information Protection Act (“PIPA Amendments”) take effect on April 1, foreign business will be subject to all obligations and restrictions under PIPA, including investigations and orders from the PIPC. Until now, these types of investigations and orders were limited to businesses located in Japan. These PIPA Amendments also impact businesses in Japan by making significant changes to existing privacy compliance requirements. The PIPA Amendments, related guidelines, and enforcement orders impose new compliance obligations in several key areas, including data breach notification, cross-border data transfers, and the use of cookies.
