<p>On March 17, 2020, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation  (FDIC) announced two significant developments relating to industrial banks  (also sometimes called industrial loan companies). First, in a notice of  proposed rulemaking (NPR), the FDIC laid out the regulatory regime it expects  to apply to companies not subject to consolidated supervision by the Board of  Governors of the Federal Reserve System (&ldquo;Federal Reserve&rdquo;) that seek to  control industrial banks.<a id="_ftnref1" name="_ftnref1" href="#_ftn1">[1]</a> Second,  the FDIC approved applications for deposit insurance submitted by Square, Inc.  and Nelnet, Inc., paving the way for these companies to establish the first <em>de novo </em>industrial banks in over a  decade.<a id="_ftnref2" name="_ftnref2" href="#_ftn2">[2]</a></p>
<p>These two developments, taken together, signal a path  forward for the use of deposit-taking industrial bank charters by companies  that cannot (or do not wish to) subject themselves to the activity restrictions  of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the &ldquo;BHC Act&rdquo;).</p>
<h4>Background</h4>
<p>The BHC Act is the principal legislation that implements the  national policy of separating banking from commerce. Under the BHC Act, any  company that controls a &ldquo;bank&rdquo; must register as a bank holding company and  abide by restrictions on the activities in which it and its affiliates can  engage.</p>
<p>Among other things, bank holding companies are prohibited  from engaging in nonbanking activities&mdash;that is, any activities that are not  &ldquo;closely related to&rdquo; banking or managing or controlling a bank, unless an  exemption applies.<a id="_ftnref3" name="_ftnref3" href="#_ftn3">[3]</a> In addition, bank holding  companies are subject to consolidated supervision by the Federal Reserve. In  other words, bank holding companies, and their nonbank subsidiaries, are  subject to Federal Reserve examination, supervision, and oversight.</p>
<p>Industrial banks were  first organized under state charters in the early 20th century as local  consumer finance companies for industrial workers, and their powers vary from  state to state. Notwithstanding the general framework created by the BHC Act,  industrial banks that are FDIC-insured depository institutions and function in  substantially the same manner as traditional banks are not considered &ldquo;banks&rdquo;  for purposes of the BHC Act if certain conditions are met. Specifically, an  industrial bank will not be considered a &ldquo;bank&rdquo; under the BHC Act if it: (1) is  chartered in one of five states (Utah, Nevada, California, Minnesota, and  Hawaii);<a id="_ftnref4" name="_ftnref4" href="#_ftn4">[4]</a> and (2) either (a) has less than $100 million in total assets or (b) does not  accept demand deposits that may be withdrawn by check.<a id="_ftnref5" name="_ftnref5" href="#_ftn5">[5]</a> Consequently,  any company that controls an industrial bank meeting these conditions is not  itself a bank holding company (solely by virtue of that fact) and is not  subject to the BHC Act&rsquo;s nonbanking activity limitations or Federal Reserve  oversight.<a id="_ftnref6" name="_ftnref6" href="#_ftn6">[6]</a></p>
<p>As a result, commercial firms, while not permitted to  control BHC Act &ldquo;banks,&rdquo; are permitted to control industrial banks. In fact,  commercial companies such as BMW, Harley Davidson, and others do control  industrial banks.</p>
<p>Industrial banks have a controversial history. Some are  concerned that industrial banks and their holding companies are at a  competitive advantage compared with BHC Act banks and their holding companies,  since commercial firms can own industrial banks. Others argue that industrial  banks inject risk into the U.S. financial system by eroding the separation  between banking and commerce and avoiding consolidated supervision. Due in part  to these concerns, the FDIC imposed an administrative moratorium on approving  industrial bank applications for deposit insurance in the mid-2000s, which was  followed by a legislative moratorium imposed by the Dodd-Frank&nbsp;Wall Street  Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the &ldquo;Dodd-Frank Act&rdquo;).<a id="_ftnref7" name="_ftnref7" href="#_ftn7">[7]</a> The  legislative moratorium under the Dodd-Frank Act expired in 2013.</p>
<p>Since 2013, and particularly in the current deregulatory  environment, there has been renewed interest in the industrial bank charter,  especially from financial technology (&ldquo;FinTech&rdquo;) companies that may not be able  to comply with the BHC Act&rsquo;s activity limitations. For these companies, the  industrial bank charter is likely to be attractive. In particular, through an  industrial bank charter, FinTechs can have access to inexpensive, stable  funding in the form of time deposits, and can export interest rates across  state lines.<a id="_ftnref8" name="_ftnref8" href="#_ftn8">[8]</a></p>
<h4>Federal  Regulation of Companies That Control Industrial Banks</h4>
<p>Although  exempt from Federal Reserve supervision, parent companies of industrial banks  are subject to regulation and oversight by the FDIC.<a id="_ftnref9" name="_ftnref9" href="#_ftn9">[9]</a> Under  the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (the &ldquo;FDI Act&rdquo;), the FDIC has the authority  to examine any affiliate of an industrial bank, including its parent company.<a id="_ftnref10" name="_ftnref10" href="#_ftn10">[10]</a> In  addition, as amended by the Dodd-Frank Act, section 38A of the FDI Act requires  the FDIC to ensure that any company that controls an industrial bank serves as  a source of financial strength for the industrial bank.<a id="_ftnref11" name="_ftnref11" href="#_ftn11">[11]</a> Authority  to regulate controlling companies of industrial banks may also be derived from  the FDIC&rsquo;s responsibility to protect the deposit insurance fund (DIF) and  ensure the safety and soundness of insured depository institutions.<a id="_ftnref12" name="_ftnref12" href="#_ftn12">[12]</a></p>
<p>Before  the Dodd-Frank Act amended Section 38A of the FDI Act to create a statutory source  of strength requirement, banking regulators applied the requirement as a matter  of supervisory policy. Section 4.3 of the FDIC&rsquo;s Risk Management Manual of  Examination Policies (last revised in 2005) explains that commercial companies  that control industrial banks may be expected to serve as &ldquo;a source of strength  for their subsidiary bank by providing access to the capital and debt markets,  and affording the opportunity to use a variety of technical services not always  available to small or mid-size banks.&rdquo;<a id="_ftnref13" name="_ftnref13" href="#_ftn13">[13]</a> The  Federal Reserve has long applied a similar source of strength requirement to  bank holding companies, noting in a 1987 Policy Statement that bank holding  companies should &ldquo;stand ready to use available resources to provide adequate  capital funds to its subsidiary banks during periods of financial stress or  adversity and should maintain the financial flexibility and capital-raising  capacity to obtain additional resources for assisting its subsidiary banks.&rdquo;<a id="_ftnref14" name="_ftnref14" href="#_ftn14">[14]</a></p>
<p>Historically,  to implement the source of strength policy, the FDIC required controlling  companies of industrial banks to enter into a capital and liquidity maintenance  agreement (CALMA). As its name suggests, a CALMA generally requires a company  that controls an industrial bank to take certain actions to support the capital  and liquidity position of the industrial bank in times of financial distress. The  FDIC has also exercised oversight over controlling companies of industrial  banks through written agreements with controlling parties, and conditions  imposed in connection with the grant of deposit insurance or issuance of a  non-objection to a change in control. Together, these measures had formed the  basic supervisory framework in which the FDIC regulated companies that control  industrial banks. As explained above, the Dodd-Frank Act turned the source of  strength policy into a mandate by explicitly requiring the FDIC to ensure that  any company that controls an industrial bank serves as a source of financial  strength for the industrial bank.</p>
<h4>Overview of the NPR</h4>
<p>If adopted, the NPR would provide transparency and  consistency to the FDIC&rsquo;s approach to regulating companies that control  industrial banks. In addition to codifying current practice, the NPR would  expand requirements in a number of key respects. &nbsp;</p>
<h5><em>Scope of Application</em></h5>
<p>The  FDIC proposes to apply the new rules solely with respect to industrial banks  that are controlled by &ldquo;Covered Companies.&rdquo; Under the NPR, the term &ldquo;Covered  Company&rdquo; means any company that is not subject to consolidated supervision by  the Federal Reserve<a id="_ftnref15" name="_ftnref15" href="#_ftn15">[15]</a> and that controls an industrial bank (in each case after the effective date of  the rule) as a result of:</p>
<p>(1) a change in bank control;<br> (2) a merger transaction; or <br> (3) a <em>de novo</em> application.<a id="_ftnref16" name="_ftnref16" href="#_ftn16">[16]</a></p>
<p>These  are the three circumstances in which the FDIC would be in a position to  consider whether an industrial bank was controlled by a Covered Company and, if  so, what restrictions or commitments the FDIC could require from the Covered  Company.<a id="_ftnref17" name="_ftnref17" href="#_ftn17">[17]</a></p>
<h5><em>Choice of Control Definition in NPR</em></h5>
<p>A  Covered Company includes only certain companies that &ldquo;control&rdquo; an industrial  bank. In all material respects, the concept of control for purposes of the NPR  is the same as the concept of control established under the Change in Bank  Control Act (CIBCA). &nbsp;In other words,  &ldquo;control&rdquo; is &ldquo;the power, directly or indirectly, to direct the management or  policies of a company or to vote 25% or more of any class of voting securities  of a company.<a id="_ftnref18" name="_ftnref18" href="#_ftn18">[18]</a> The definition of  &ldquo;control&rdquo; would also include the CIBCA&rsquo;s rebuttable presumptions of control,  pursuant to which a company that holds 10% or more of any class of voting  securities of another company is presumed to control the other company if: (1)  shares of the other company are registered under section 12 of the Securities  Exchange Act of 1934 or (2) no other person owns a greater share of that class  of voting securities of the other company.<a id="_ftnref19" name="_ftnref19" href="#_ftn19">[19]</a> Finally,  the definition of &ldquo;control&rdquo; would include the CIBCA&rsquo;s rebuttable presumptions  of acting in concert.<a id="_ftnref20" name="_ftnref20" href="#_ftn20">[20]</a></p>
<p>As a  result of the control presumptions taken from the CIBCA, there is a disparity  between what level of ownership would trigger control under the BHC Act and  under the NPR. For example, under the BHC Act definition of control, there is  no presumption of control for shareholders holding 10% or more of any class of  voting securities of another company even where the shareholder is the largest  shareholder in the company or the company&rsquo;s securities are registered (absent  other indicia of control).<a id="_ftnref21" name="_ftnref21" href="#_ftn21">[21]</a></p>
<p>On  one hand, it is understandable that the FDIC would adopt the CIBCA definition  of control since a CIBCA notice is one of the circumstances under which the  FDIC would be in a position to evaluate controlling shareholders of industrial  banks. However, from a policy perspective, there could be circumstances where  the disparity creates an incongruence in the regulation of bank holding  companies and Covered Companies.</p>
<h5><em>Requirements Imposed  on Covered Companies</em></h5>
<p>The  NPR would require Covered Companies to enter into a written agreement with the  FDIC and its industrial bank subsidiary as a condition of the FDIC&rsquo;s  non-objection to a change in control notice, or approval of a merger or deposit  insurance application. The agreement would require the Covered Company to do  the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Submit an initial listing of all subsidiaries  and update such list annually;</li>
<li>Consent to the examination by the FDIC of the  Covered Company and each of its subsidiaries;</li>
<li>Submit an annual report to the FDIC, and any  other such reports as requested by the FDIC;<a id="_ftnref22" name="_ftnref22" href="#_ftn22">[22]</a></li>
<li>Maintain such records as the FDIC may deem  necessary to assess the risks to the subsidiary industrial bank or to the DIF;</li>
<li>Cause an annual, independent audit of each  subsidiary industrial bank;</li>
<li>Limit direct or indirect representation of the  Covered Company on the board of directors or board of managers of each  subsidiary industrial bank to no more than 25%;</li>
<li>Maintain the capital and liquidity of the  subsidiary industrial bank at such levels as the FDIC deems appropriate, and  take such other actions as the FDIC deems appropriate to provide the subsidiary  industrial bank with a resource for additional capital and liquidity;<a id="_ftnref23" name="_ftnref23" href="#_ftn23">[23]</a></li>
<li>Execute a tax allocation agreement with its  subsidiary industrial bank;<a id="_ftnref24" name="_ftnref24" href="#_ftn24">[24]</a> and</li>
<li>Provide any additional commitments as required  by the FDIC in its sole discretion. </li>
</ul>
<p>These  requirements would enable the FDIC to have complete and timely information on  the activities of the Covered Company and its affiliates. And many of the  requirements are not controversial or particularly onerous since they are  already required elsewhere in the law (for reporting, recordkeeping, audits,  etc.) or have historically been required by the FDIC in connection with  applications from industrial banks (the CALMA requirement).</p>
<p>However,  the limitation on board representation of the Covered Company to 25% or less of  the industrial bank&rsquo;s board seems to be a new requirement and one that would be  particularly restrictive.<a id="_ftnref25" name="_ftnref25" href="#_ftn25">[25]</a> The  FDIC stated in the preamble to the NPR that the limitation is intended to  &ldquo;limit the extent of each Covered Company&rsquo;s influence over a subsidiary  industrial bank.&rdquo;<a id="_ftnref26" name="_ftnref26" href="#_ftn26">[26]</a> But  it is unclear what purpose is served by limiting a Covered Company&rsquo;s influence  over an industrial bank when such company is already deemed to be in a control  position. And limiting board representation to a significant minority position  may reduce a Covered Company&rsquo;s ability to effectively provide operational  control and adequate oversight, commensurate with its control position. Moreover,  restricting board representation in this manner is not necessarily consistent  with the source of strength requirement that attaches to control. Although  Square, Inc. and Nelnet, Inc. accepted this limit on board representation as a  condition to their respective approvals, as discussed below, it will be  interesting to see whether this feature is subject to significant critical  comment.</p>
<p>Finally,  under the NPR, the FDIC would reserve the authority to require, in its sole  discretion, an individual who is a controlling shareholder of the Covered Company  to enter into a written agreement with the commitments described above as a  condition for its approval. This is not consistent with the treatment of  shareholders that are individuals under the BHC Act and the NPR does not  provide any standards or guidance as to when the FDIC would or would not  exercise this discretion. Nevertheless, as discussed below, the individual  controlling shareholders of both Square, Inc. and Nelnet, Inc. joined the  commitments made in connection with their respective approvals.</p>
<h5><em>Contingency Plan</em></h5>
<p>Under  the NPR, the FDIC would have the authority to require a Covered Company and its  industrial bank subsidiary to submit to the FDIC and comply with a contingency  plan. The contingency plan would set forth, &ldquo;at a minimum, recovery actions to  address significant financial or operational stress that could threaten the  safe and sound operation of the industrial bank and one or more strategies for  the orderly disposition of such industrial bank without the need for the  appointment of a receiver or conservator.&rdquo;<a id="_ftnref27" name="_ftnref27" href="#_ftn27">[27]</a> The  contingency plan would be subject to the FDIC&rsquo;s approval.</p>
<p>A  contingency plan would not be a resolution plan (as required by the Dodd-Frank  Act), since it would address the steps an institution should take to mitigate  financial and operational stress outside of receivership. However, like a  resolution plan, it would facilitate an understanding of the risks and types of  events that could create a safety and soundness issue for an industrial bank.</p>
<p>In  the preamble to the NPR, the FDIC explains that the requirement is described in  general terms to give the FDIC flexibility to tailor its application to each  industrial bank based on its size, complexity and interdependencies.<a id="_ftnref28" name="_ftnref28" href="#_ftn28">[28]</a> However,  this intentional vagueness creates uncertainty as to what the FDIC may require  and how the contingency plan requirement would be used for supervisory  purposes.</p>
<h5><em>Requirements Imposed on Industrial Banks</em></h5>
<p>Under  the NPR, the FDIC would impose additional restrictions on industrial banks that  are subsidiaries of Covered Companies. Specifically, the NPR would require  prior approval from the FDIC for such industrial banks to do any of the  following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make a material change in its business plan; </li>
<li>Add or replace a member of the board of  directors, board of managers, or a managing member;</li>
<li>Add or replace a senior executive officer; </li>
<li>Employ a senior executive officer who is  associated in any manner (e.g., as a director, officer, employee, agent, owner,  partner, or consultant) with an affiliate of the industrial bank;<a id="_ftnref29" name="_ftnref29" href="#_ftn29">[29]</a> or</li>
<li>Enter into any contract for services material to  the operations of the industrial bank (for example, a loan servicing function)  with such Covered Company or any subsidiary thereof; or</li>
<li>Any additional restrictions on the operations or  activities of the industrial bank in the FDIC&rsquo;s sole discretion.</li>
</ul>
<p>These  restrictions&nbsp;are largely consistent with&nbsp;the FDIC&rsquo;s current practice with respect to <em>de novo </em>bank applications. However, what  may be different is that historically, conditions imposed on <em>de novo </em>charters generally expire after  a three-year period (although it is not uncommon for no limitation to apply if  necessary to mitigate risk).<a id="_ftnref30" name="_ftnref30" href="#_ftn30">[30]</a> Under  the NPR, there is no time limitation on the conditions imposed on  industrial banks as listed above.</p>
<h5><em>Conditional Approvals</em></h5>
<p>In  the preamble to the NPR, the FDIC also indicates it may impose additional  requirements on Covered Companies through conditional approvals of applications  or non-objections to change in control notices. These conditions may be  enforced pursuant to the FDIC&rsquo;s authority under the FDI Act. Because the FDIC  already has this authority, the FDIC stated that &ldquo;it is not necessary to  include provisions regarding conditions in the [NPR].&rdquo;<a id="_ftnref31" name="_ftnref31" href="#_ftn31">[31]</a></p>
<h4>Nelnet and Square Approvals</h4>
<p>While the FDIC has entertained a number applications from  would-be shareholders in industrial banks in recent years, the absence of any  approvals raised the question of whether the charter&rsquo;s use by FinTech firms was  actually a viable option. The FDIC has now answered the question by approving  applications from Square, Inc. and Nelnet, Inc. and the industrial bank charter  is now more than a theoretical option for FinTech companies.</p>
<p>According to the FDIC&rsquo;s press releases, Square, Inc. will  use its industrial bank subsidiary to originate commercial loans for merchants  that are already existing customers of its payment system.<a id="_ftnref32" name="_ftnref32" href="#_ftn32">[32]</a> Nelnet,  Inc. will use its bank affiliate to originate and service consumer loans,  including private student loans, which is complementary to its core business.<a id="_ftnref33" name="_ftnref33" href="#_ftn33">[33]</a> Both  companies stated that they intend to offer deposit products.<a id="_ftnref34" name="_ftnref34" href="#_ftn34">[34]</a></p>
<p>The path for both of these companies to gain approval was  long. In fact, both companies previously submitted applications for deposit  insurance, only to withdraw them prior to a determination by the FDIC.</p>
<p>While mostly aligned with the NPR, in some respects, the  conditions accepted by Square, Inc. and Nelnet, Inc. in connection with their  application approvals are less restrictive than those that would be required  under the NPR. For example, while the NPR would require industrial bank  subsidiaries of Covered Companies to obtain the FDIC&rsquo;s approval for any changes  to its senior management or board of directors in perpetuity, the new  industrial bank subsidiaries of Square, Inc. and Nelnet, Inc. are required to  obtain such approvals only for the first three years of operation. Since the  Square, Inc. and Nelnet, Inc. industrial banks would be grandfathered under the  NPR, the new rules would not apply to these companies.</p>
<p>The chart below describes certain restrictions imposed on  Square, Inc. and Nelnet, Inc. in connection with their approvals for deposit  insurance and shows how the restrictions compare to those proposed in the NPR.<a id="_ftnref35" name="_ftnref35" href="#_ftn35">[35]</a></p>

The exclusion applies to any insured  depository institution that does not have and is not controlled by a company  that has (i) more than $10 billion in total consolidated assets; or (ii) total  trading assets and trading liabilities (on a consolidated basis) that are more  than 5% of total consolidated assets. 12 U.S.C. &sect; 1851(h)(1)(B).

Most if not all FBOs would likely meet this standard even  though they may be subject to consolidated supervision by their home country  supervisor. It can be expected that this situation will be addressed by  commenters on the NPR. In principle, given the regime of supervision and  regulation of FBOs, there are strong policy reasons why FBOs should not be  deemed to be &ldquo;Covered Companies.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a id="_ftn16" name="_ftn16" href="#_ftnref16">[16]</a> There could be multiple  Covered Companies for a single industrial bank, for example, where one company  controls another company that controls an industrial bank or where more than  one company holds a control position in the industrial bank. <em>See </em>85 Fed. Reg. at 17777.</p>
<p><a id="_ftn17" name="_ftn17" href="#_ftnref17">[17]</a> In the first  circumstance, a Covered Company would have to apply to file a notice with the  FDIC of its intention to exercise control over an industrial bank under the  Change in Bank Control Act (CIBCA). In the second circumstance, if a company  merged into an industrial bank, the FDIC would have approval authority under  the Bank Merger Act (12 U.S.C. &sect; 1828). In the case of such a merger, if a  Covered Company were to control the merged institutions following the merger,  the FDIC would have the opportunity to approve (or disapprove of) the  circumstances under which the Covered Company would control the merged  institutions. In the third circumstance, if a company sought to organize an  industrial bank <em>de novo</em> (as with the  Square, Inc. and Nelnet, Inc. applications) the FDIC would be in a position to  evaluate any Covered Company.</p>

<p><a id="_ftn20" name="_ftn20" href="#_ftnref20">[20]</a> 12 C.F.R. &sect; 303.82(b)(2)  establishes a number of rebuttable presumptions of &ldquo;acting in concert.&rdquo; Specifically,  the following persons are presumed to be acting in concert: (i) a company and  any controlling shareholder or management official of the company; (ii) an  individual and one or more members of the individual&rsquo;s immediate family; (iii)  companies under common control or a company and each company it controls; (iv)  two or more persons that have made, or propose to make, a joint filing related  to the proposed acquisition under section 13 or 14 of the Securities Exchange  Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. &sect; 78m or 78n), and the rules promulgated thereunder by  the Securities and Exchange Commission; (v) a person and any trust for which  the person serves as trustee or any trust for which the person is a  beneficiary; and (vi) persons that are parties to any agreement, contract,  understanding, relationship, or other arrangement, whether written or  otherwise, regarding the acquisition, voting, or transfer of control of voting  securities of a covered institution, other than through revocable proxies as  described in C.F.R. &sect;&nbsp;303.84(a)(5). 12 C.F.R. &sect; 303.82.</p>
<p><a id="_ftn21" name="_ftn21" href="#_ftnref21">[21]</a> Recently, the Federal  Reserve published a final rule, which establishes and revises certain  presumptions used to analyze whether one company controls another company for  purposes of the BHC Act and Regulation Y. Our client alert on this final rule,  is available at <a href="200219-federal-reserve-issues.html">https://www.mofo.com/resources/insights/200219-federal-reserve-issues.html</a>.</p>
<p><a id="_ftn22" name="_ftn22" href="#_ftnref22">[22]</a> Such other reports would  be used to inform the FDIC as to the Covered Company&rsquo;s: (1) financial  condition; (2)&nbsp;systems for identifying, measuring, monitoring, and  controlling financial and operational risks; (3) transactions with depository  institution subsidiaries of the Covered Company; and (4) compliance with  applicable provisions of the FDI Act and any other law or regulation.</p>
<p><a id="_ftn23" name="_ftn23" href="#_ftnref23">[23]</a> Such actions may include,  for example, pledging assets, obtaining and maintaining a letter of credit from  a third-party institution acceptable to the FDIC, and providing indemnification  of the subsidiary industrial bank.</p>
<p><a id="_ftn24" name="_ftn24" href="#_ftnref24">[24]</a> The tax allocation  agreement must expressly state that &ldquo;an agency relationship exists between the  Covered Company and the subsidiary industrial bank with respect to tax assets  generated by such industrial bank, and further state[] that all such tax assets  are held in trust by the Covered Company for the benefit of the subsidiary  industrial bank and will be promptly remitted to such industrial bank. The tax  allocation agreement must also provide that the amount and timing of any  payments or refunds to the subsidiary industrial bank by the Covered Company  should be no less favorable than if the subsidiary industrial bank were a  separate taxpayer.&rdquo;</p>

Non-standard  conditions may also address corporate relationships, management authority and  independence, and other areas, as appropriate.
