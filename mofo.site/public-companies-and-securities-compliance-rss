      <title>Jarkesy, Cochran, and the Attack on ALJs</title>
      <description>        On May 18, 2022, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in Jarkesy v. SEC issued a scathing rebuke of the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (“SEC”) use of administrative law judges (“ALJ”).[1] Considered in tandem with the U.S. Supreme Court’s May 16, 2022 grant of certiorari in SEC v. Cochran,[2] which examines district courts’ jurisdiction to consider actions to enjoin ongoing SEC administrative actions, Jarkesy may have profound implications for the SEC’s—and other federal agencies’—use of ALJs in a wide array of matters.

      <title>Forecasting White Collar Enforcement Trends in California for 2022</title>
      <description>        In the first year of the Biden administration, leadership at the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and other U.S. government agencies announced expansive efforts to investigate and prosecute white-collar crime. These efforts included the creation of task forces and policy changes that grant the government greater resources and powers to pursue white-collar criminal enforcement actions.[i] In California, the new year brings with it several noteworthy white-collar trials in federal courts around the state as well as expectations that we will see enhanced enforcement actions as the current administration focuses on corporate crime, government procurement fraud, and pandemic-related fraud.

      <title>Takeaways for In-House Counsel from the SEC’s “Shadow Insider Trading” Action</title>
      <description>        In January 2022, a federal district court denied a motion to dismiss a novel insider trading enforcement action brought by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission based upon a theory known as “shadow insider trading.” In SEC v. Panuwat, the SEC takes the position that the insider trading laws apply where an insider uses material nonpublic information about his or her own company to trade securities of another company, such as a competitor or peer company in the same industry.
